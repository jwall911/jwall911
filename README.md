<h1> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jwall911</h1>
<ul>
  <li> Iâ€™m interested in programming, reading, fitness, MMA, travelling and spending time with loved ones!</li> 
  <li> Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science at Northeastern State University in Oklahoma (junior yr)</li>
  <li> I will be creating projects and hosting them on this platform and replit!</li> (replit.com/@jwall911)
  <br /><h3>Also...</h3><br />
  <li> If you'd like to collaborate, I currently create Java and C++ programs (around beginner-intermediate level)</li>
  <li> I am currently interested in part-time employment in any IT related field, software development preferred!</li>
  <li> You can reach me at: linkedin.com/jwall911 and see other projects at: replit.com/@jwall911</li>
  </br>
 <p> I'd label myself as a beginner, but I am practicing every day to become better. Soon I'd like to see myself being a Software Engineer, then possibly a Project Manager. Once I've fulfilled my programming desires, I look forward to teaching and mentoring others. </p>
  <h2> Thanks for visiting! </h2>
